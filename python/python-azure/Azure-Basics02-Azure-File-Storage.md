```python
# Import modules
from azure.storage.file import FileService 
```

# 2. Microsoft File Storage

## 2.1. Mount a new Azure File Storage


```python
# Mount a new Azure File Storage as a drive
file_service = FileService(account_name='meow94storage',
                           account_key='fA9o3JiS3RV09nYlLK+y+9mH4sP/uDgyOhTCKsXpoj2LMjCwvOLC67vY8PmwiwvgLO8GvhsZ/iWj+AStUq6zzQ==')

```


```python
#Add a new Fileshare
file_service.create_share('myshare')
```




    True



## 2.2. Add a new Directory to Azure File Share


```python
# Azure file ShareÏóê ÎîîÎ†âÌÜ†Î¶¨ ÏÉùÏÑ±
file_service.create_directory('myshare', 'directory_01')  # create_directory('name of file share', 'Name of new directory')
```




    True



## 2.3. Upload to Azure File Storage


```python
# Import module related to content settings
from azure.storage.file import ContentSettings
```


```python
file_service.create_file_from_path(
    'myshare',       # Name of File Share to upload
    'directory_01',  # Folder path to upload
    'meow1.png',     # Set a name of file to upload
    '1.png'          # Name of file to upload on local storage
)
```

## 2.3. Check a Directory


```python
# Get a list of files in Directory
generator = file_service.list_directories_and_files('myshare')  # list_directories_and_files(Name of FileShare)

# Print contents of files
for file_or_dir in generator:
  print(file_or_dir.name)

```

    meow1.png
    myfile
    directory_01
    

## 2.4. Download files from Azure File Storage to Local storage


```python
# Download
file_service.get_file_to_path('myshare',            # name of File Share
                              None,                 # No specific paths
                              'meow1.png',          # Target file name to download on Azure server
                              'meow1_download.png') # File name to save on local storage
```

## 2.5. Snapshot 


```python
# Snapshot: Snapshot is a backup image to restore files and directories
```


```python
# Create a metadata for test
metadata = {'foo' : 'bar'}
```


```python
# Create a Snapshot
snapshot = file_service.snapshot_share('myshare',          # Set a storage to make a snapshot
                                       metadata=metadata)  # Metadata for snapshot
```


```python
# Get a list of Snapshots from Azure
share = list(file_service.list_shares(include_snapshots=True))
```


```python
# Get a list of directories and files

directories_and_files = list(file_service.list_directories_and_files('myshare',   # Name of File Share
                                                                     snapshot='2023-04-20T05:49:37.0000000Z')) # Name of Snapshot
# Print a list of Files and Directories
for file_or_dir in directories_and_files:
  print(file_or_dir.name)
```

    myfile
    directory_01
    

## 2.6. Delete


```python
# Delete Snapshots
file_service.delete_share('myshare',
                          snapshot='2023-04-20T05:49:37.0000000Z')
```




    True




```python
# Delete File Shares
file_service.delete_file('myshare',
                         None,     
                         '1.png')  # File name to be deleted
```


```python
# Delete a directory in a Snapshot image
file_service.delete_directory('myshare', # Name of File Share
                              'directory_01')  # Folders to be deleted
```


```python
# Delete File Share
file_service.delete_directory('myshare')  # Name of File Share to be deleted
```
